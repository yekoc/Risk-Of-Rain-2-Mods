#What?
---
Makes it so that Brainstalks(and other things that use the same effect) eliminates cooldowns by directly giving you a new stock,thus bypassing the half-second global cooldown.\
Basically Brainstalk now acts more like having infinite stocks,rather than having zero cooldown.Of course,you still need to have enough stocks available if a skill requires multiple,It's not __actually__ infinite stocks.

#Whats with the Name?

I don't have a cool pun to shake your world this time,I know,I know,It's highly disappointing.\
My Apologies.

#Why?
---
Some Character's animations make the small global cooldown delay _very_ apparent and I do not like how that feels,at all.
