#What?
---
Makes the size of Loader's alternate special,ThunderSlam,scale with your downward velocity.There is a config option to adjust how strong the effect is,be careful changing it ,it ramps faster than you would think.
If you find a value that feels better than the default,tell me,I will change it to that.
Was *not* tested in multiplayer,I get the hunch that it would break if multiple Loaders tried to Slam at the same time,cleans up well after itself though,so any breakages ought to be temporary.

#Whats with the Name?
---
It's a pun.See the game has that one keyword 'Heavy' that makes things deal more damage with speed.
This also scales with speed but it aint damage so I can't call it 'Heavy'.So it's just 'weighty' instead.
Get it?Get it?Get it?Is this funny yet?

#Why?
---
I dunno,someone asked for it and it took me like an hour and a half `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`.
