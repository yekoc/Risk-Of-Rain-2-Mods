#What?

Reverts the Burn related changes from the newest update back to the old formula.\
This is theoretically a buff to characters with lower health but not really.

Affects;
 * OnHitEnemy Burn (From the DamageType,most burns are this)
 * ProcIgniteOnHit Burn (Gasoline,any modded effect making use of the same path)
 * Grandparent Sun (Grandparents( :^) ),Paladin when he gets updated)

Does _not_ affect;
 * Hellfire Tincture
 * Original Burn sources from mods that do not use one of the vanilla methods.
