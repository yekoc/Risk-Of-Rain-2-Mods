#What?
---
Makes it so that Overheat from the grandparent sun(and other things that use the same effect) affects all sources of burn equally,instead of being tracked by the source for manual application.\
Might be overpowered if another balance mod accidentally undoes the thing that prevents the grandparents from double dipping into the boost.\
You can also manually bring that upon yourself in the config,if you want to,or find yourself needing to for compatibility reasons.

#Whats with the Name?
---
The buff is named Overheat,it's applied by a Sun,you can figure it out.

#Why?
---
It was disappointing that it only applied to The Unmatched Power of The Sun. Also Paladin synergy.\
Also also, I really wanted to make this icon edit.

Credit to the GNU image manipulation program for helping me make the icon.\
Credit to cute anime girls for giving me the will to continue living.
