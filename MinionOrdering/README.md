#What?
---
Pinging an ally that considers you it's Leader or pressing a (configurable) button to call everyone's attention will put them in a state wherein they interpret your next ping and attempt to act accordingly.\
Their desire to follow these orders is quite overzealous,however.Make sure they don't get hurt waiting on your command.
