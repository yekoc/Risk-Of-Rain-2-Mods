#What?
---
First Person Mod,press configurable key (numpad_5 by default) to toggle first person.\
There is a configurable option to hide your character model if it annoys you that looking downwards shows it.

Risk of Options support is included.

#Whats with the Icon?
---
It's the icon for the old first person mod but I slapped the ingame NEW sign on to it,because it's new (it isn't a port of the old mod,mind you,the game changed the camera code too much for it to be ported).\
The original icon seems to be a firing sprite from a Doom WAD? It's not an exact match for the vanilla doom one,migh be freedoom idk.

Credit to the GNU image manipulation program for helping me make the icon.\
Credit to cute anime girls for giving me the will to continue living.
