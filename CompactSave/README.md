#What?
---
Makes it so that profile stat entries with the default value don't get saved to file.

#Why?
---
The game sets any missing entries to the default value so it doesn't actually effect anything except file size.

#Yeah But,_Why_?
---
Admittedly,the files don't take up much space in the first place,which is probably why this isn't a vanilla feature.\
But when you add in new content with mods you get a whole bunch of functionally useless entries due to the way perBody/perItem stat tracking is handled,which... still isn't that much.\
But they annoyed me.
