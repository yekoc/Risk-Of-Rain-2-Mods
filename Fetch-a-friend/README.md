#What?
---
Makes it so that completeing Rex's unlock quest gives you an allied Rex,by default he grabs a copy of the inventory of the player that gives him maintanence,he also scales by ambient level like other minions.\
The config lets you both turn off the item sharing thing and/or also make it so that he respawns at the start of the next stage if killed,though by default he is gone forever once he breaks.

#Whats with the Name?
---
See the unlock thing is a fetch quest,since you have to fetch the Fuel Array for Rex,this mod gives you a reason to do it again after unlocking by rewarding you with a Friend.\
It's a quest to Fetch a Friend,get it? Fetch(a friend) Quest.\
I am a comedic genius.
