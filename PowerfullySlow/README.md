#What?
---
Makes it so that sessions with hosts who have not yet beat the main ending (unlocked Captain) are taken to the older version of the moon instead.\
This is useful because,while it gets repetitive after a few dozen playthroughs,the old moon is still a great vessel for the player to experience Con Lentitud Poderosa,also known to some as Coalescense 2.

Now includes a configurable chance to get the old moon in repeat runs as well,the roll for it is done by the host at run start.\
Also lets you walk out of Mitchell's boss arena after the fight,cause old moon doesn't have the emergency escape bubbles and I couldn't be bothered to add them.\
Marked Incompatible with UnlockAll because the mod depends on your unlock status to determine if it needs to do anything.

#Whats with the Name?
